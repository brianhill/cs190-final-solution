## Test-Taking Rules

1. You can't consult each other on-line or look at each others' repos.
2. However, you can use any other on-line references, especially all of my repos and all of your repos, like the repo for the midterm.

## Scoring

Each Part is a playground and is worth 4 points. There are 5 playgrounds total. So there are 20 pts total.

## Directions

It's a good idea to quit and restart Xcode when working on different parts and only work on one part at a time. Don't get bogged down on a part. If a part is taking you more than 15 minutes, move along.

Part I might be the hardest because you have to know some polynomials. If the polynomials are throwing you off, just go on to the other four parts. Come back later and read the links that I put into Part I, especially the link to the definition of Bezier curves.

Finally, during the test it's a good idea to occasionally do:

    $ git add --all
    $ git commit -m "Note to self about what you just accomplished."
    $ git push origin master

That way you won't lose much work if Xcode explodes.
